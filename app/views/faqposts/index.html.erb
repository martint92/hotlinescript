        Thank you so much much volunteering to answer questions from Harvey survivors. This guide has some frequently asked questions. Please feel free to add comments if you hear additional questions or have suggestions to add to the answer sections.

        We want the immigrant community to know that they have power to make change.  If you get the impression that an individual wants to get more involved, encourage them to organize with other immigrants. If they fill out <%= link_to "this link,", 'http://bit.ly/HouHotlineQ' %> they’ll be contacted by an immigrant rights organizer.
